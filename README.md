With these 3d models you can build your own solder fume extractor!
It's filtered by a charcoal filter in front of the fan and by a hepa filter in the back (both 0.5mm thick).
The fan is a simple office cooling fan which I got gifted it's weak but it still makes it's job. The filters are 0.5mm for that exact reason.
The whole build will take about 140 to 180g (x2 for 2 filters) + 260g (Main part) of filament.
Very much filament is wasted for supports but at the end I'm still very happy how it came out :D

WARNING: If you are going to print the screws please make sure to add a XY-Compensation (e.g. in Bambu Slicer) of 0.1 to 0.15mm for the holes, else the screws and nuts won't fit together!!
